## Note

1. The cropper uses [react-easy-crop] under the hood. For fully flexible cropper, see [react-easy-crop]. But you will need to implement the cropped image getter algorithm yourself.
2. As [react-easy-crop] uses `position: relative;` and `position: absolute;` to locate its components, the outer div of the cropper is recommended to be fixed-size. Otherwise some initial render problems may occur.
